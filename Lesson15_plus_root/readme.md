# Lesson15_plus_root

## Second in a series of OpenCascade C++ examples modified to work on Ubuntu

* This code is based on the code in the project `Lesson15` but places the resulting CAD assembly under a **root** level.

* It composes a document  capable of being displayed and saves the document to file `test.xbf`

* The document can be opened using CadAssistant

## Oh, by the way, a copy of the file `compose_plus_root.py` is included in this folder for handy reference.
