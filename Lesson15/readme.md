# Lesson15 (in C++ on Ubuntu)

## First in a series of OpenCascade C++ examples modified to work on Ubuntu

* The original (Lesson15_compose-XDE) only works on Windows.
* In order to get this to run on Ubuntu, the code which enables display has been removed.
* This code composes a document  capable of being displayed but instead just saves the doecument to file `test.xbf`
* That document can be opened using CadAssistant

## Oh, by the way, a copy of the file `compose-XDE.py` is included in this folder for handy reference.
